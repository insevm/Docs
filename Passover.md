### INSC+

As is widely acknowledged, **INSC** represents the first-ever inscription on the Ethereum **Virtual Machine (EVM)** in history. It innovatively employs smart contract event data to store inscription information, thereby ensuring its permanent presence on the Ethereum blockchain. Moreover, this approach guarantees decentralization and significantly enhances the programmability of inscriptions, unlocking a broader spectrum of application scenarios.

**INSC**, as an experimental product ðŸ§ª, was quite successful. However, since it had never been tested nor audited by any third-party auditing firm, the experiment eventually exploded ðŸ’¥, resulting in injuries to many people. From another perspective, the results of this experiment suggest that the new EVM inscription ecosystem could potentially flourish. Users have shown immense interest and enthusiasm for INSC, which has far exceeded our expectations.&#x20;



To further promote the prosperity of the EVM inscription ecosystem, we are about to launch **INSC Plus(INSC+)**. **INSC+** is the first practical application of [**ERC7583**](https://github.com/insevm/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7583.md) and the first perfect fusion of **ERC20** and **ERC721** tokens.

**INSC+** inherits the characteristic of using EVM's Event data to store inscription data. And it allows for the coexistence of both ERC721 and ERC20 token feature and functionalities. Users will be able to trade INSC+ simultaneously on Opensea and Uniswap.

We have conducted comprehensive testing on **INSC+** and invited third-party audit firm to audit **INSC+**. To prevent others from stealing our hard work, the contract code and audit report will be published before the activation of **INSC+** inscriptions.

As you might imagine, **INSC+** will pioneer a new form of asset, completely breaking down the barriers between fungible tokens (FT) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). This will link the prices in NFT markets with those in decentralized exchanges, leading to a new understanding of decentralized finance.

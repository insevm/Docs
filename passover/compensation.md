# Compensation

## Background

In the process of advancing the INSC+ inscribe project, we have noticed a large number of inactive users who seem to have lost interest in INS.EVM. Consequently, we have implemented a claim application program. We encourage users to actively submit their claims. For those who do not initiate a claim, we will not offer compensation. This measure is designed to ensure that only users who genuinely care and participate can receive appropriate compensation.

## Compensation plan

In our compensation plan, only users who submit an application and meet the eligibility criteria will receive corresponding compensation. First, we will review whether users qualify for INSC+. For those who do, we will compensate them with INSC+ as per our policy. As for users who do not meet the criteria, they will be handled according to our original plan.

### How is INSC+ distributed to users who have filed a claim?

For users familiar with our refund policy, the following image will surely be recognizable. Due to the small number of users who opted for a refund, the qualification for INSC+ inscribing naturally passed to Category C users. However, many of these C users have since forgotten about INS.EVM. In light of this, we've decided to adopt a new strategy: we will skip the hacker phase and directly award the inscribing qualification to Category D users, or even those in subsequent categories.

Note⚠️: Only when the TokenId purchased by a Category D user has not yet been inscribed, are they eligible to receive INSC+. If the TokenId associated with a Category D user has already been inscribed, they will not be eligible to receive any other uninscribed INSC+.



### The compensation rules for users who did not receive INSC+

We will conduct a detailed data organization for all users who have submitted a claim application but did not receive INSC+. Upon completing this step, we will implement compensation measures for these users according to the plan originally formulated.

We will issue you a debt token, Debt-ETH, at a 1:1 ratio with ETH, which we promise to rigidly redeem in the future. If you lack confidence in us, you can sell Debt-ETH to users who are willing to trust us. In the future, we will also add more value to Debt-ETH probably.
